# üçΩÔ∏è Eat Collective

_Eat Collective is a versatile, food-centered blog where users can register/login to share stories and upload images, while exploring diverse categories such as travel, art, and technology._

_This project consists of two repositories: a **Client (Frontend)** built with React and a **Server (Backend)** built with Node.js, Express, and Knex for database management. Follow the steps below to set up and run the application._

  git clone https://github.com/jennifern6/eat-collective-client.git
  ```

- **Server (Backend)**:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/jennifern6/eat-collective-server.git

  ```

**Step 4: Set Up the Backend (Server)**
The backend uses Knex for database management. Follow these steps to set up the database:

- **Run the migrations to set up the database schema:**

  ```
  npx knex migrate:latest
  ```

- **Populate the database with seed data:**
  ```bash
  npx knex seed:run
  ```

**Step 5: Start the Development Servers**
Start the development servers for both repositories:

- **Client (Frontend)**:

  ```
  npm run dev
  ```

- **Server (Backend)**:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
  **Step 6: Access the Application**
  Start the development servers for both repositories:
- Open the **Frontend** by visiting http://localhost:5173 in your browser
- Ensure the **Backend** server is running on its configured port, http://localhost:8800

**Additional Notes**

- Ensure you have **Node.js** and npm installed on your system
- Confirm your database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) is set up and running
- Update the .env file in the Server folder with the necessary environment variables (e.g., database credentials)
- **Username and Password (created)**:
  ```
  User 1: Username: Jen Password: jen
  User 2: Username: Sophia Password: sophia
  ```
